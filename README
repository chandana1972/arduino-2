This project is a collection of libraries and examples for controlling
an Arduino Uno / ATMega 328P.

Please be aware that, unless stated otherwise, all code is tailored
towards the Arduino Uno and might not work on other Arduinos.

Furthermore, the individual parts are far from complete and only
advance as I work on new projects.
